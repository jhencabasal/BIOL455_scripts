### Preface
This is an interactive [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook file that follows (with some modifications) the text of Chapter 1 of [*Getting started with R: an introduction for biologists, 2nd edition*](http://r4all.org/) by Andrew P. Beckerman, Dylan Z. Childs, and Owen L. Petchey. 

The first thing you should do is click *File*, and then *Save As* on the menu bar above and rename the file "Your Last Name_ch1.Rmd"

### Learning objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Identify the different windows of the RStudio interface;

* Write and execute a short code script;

* Install a code ‘package’;

* Access the "Help" function;

* Create a plot.

### Introduction
R is a powerful open source programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. There are several key features and characteristics that make R worth the effort to learn:

* It is freely available and cross-platform (e.g., it works in Mac OS, Windows, and Linux). This means that no matter where you are and with whom you work, you can share data, figures, analyses, and, most importantly, the instructions (also known as scripts) used to generate the figures and analyses;
    
* R is an interpreted programming language. It does not involve extensive use of menus; you type commands instead. This means that you have to know what to ask R, why you are asking for it, and how to interpret the answers you get;
    
* R can replace multiple specialized programs you might otherwise need to use to visualize and model your data, resulting in a much more efficient workflow;
    
* By saving the scripts (sets of commands) you create in R, you will have a permanent, repeatable, annotated, and shareable record of your analyses.
  
Okay, since you have successfully downloaded and installed R and RStudio (a free application that makes interacting with R much easier), let's get started...

### RStudio layout
The RStudio interface consists of several windows or panes:

* The bottom left is the *Console* pane, where you can type a command after the > prompt and R will then execute it. Although this sounds like it might be the most important window because this is where R actually does stuff, we will typically only type in the Console to ask R for help (and maybe not even then - more on that later). The Console pane is likely minimized below; you can expand it my clicking anywhere on the bar;

* The top left (this window) is the *Script* pane, where collections of commands (a *script*) can be edited and saved. If you do not see the Script pane when you start a new R process, you can open it with *File* > *New File* > *R script*. Just typing a command in the Script pane is not enough, it has to get into the Console before R will execute it. If you want to run a line from the Script pane (or the whole script), you can click *Run* on the upper right tab of the script window, or press *Command+Enter* (Mac OS) or *Control+Enter* (Windows) to send it to the Console;

* The top right pane has two important tabs: *Environment* and *History*. In the environment tab you can import data and see which data and values R has in its memory; you can view and edit these values by clicking on them. The history tab shows what has been typed previously in the current R session;

* The bottom right pane has five tabs: *Files*, *Plots*, *Packages*, *Help*, and *Viewer*. Here you can open files, view plots, install and load packages, use the help function, or view local web content;

You can change the size of the windows in RStudio by dragging the gray bars between them. Try that now...

### Using R as a calculator
R can be used as a calculator - it can divide, multiply, add and subtract, and does so in the correct order. It can also raise to powers, log numbers, do trigonometry, solve systems of differential equations... and lots of other maths. Just type an equation into a gray code chunk and execute the code by clicking the *Run* button (green arrow) within the chunk or on the toolbar above, or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Command+Shift+Enter* (Mac OS) or *Control+Shift+Enter* (Windows); the results will appear beneath the code. You can add a new code chunk to the notebook by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar, and then *R*; or by pressing *Command+Option+I* (Mac OS) or *Control+Alt+I* (Windows).

Your turn. Type 1 + 1 in the chunk below and press Run:
```{r}

1 + 1

```

The instruction you just gave R was a question: "What is the answer to 1 + 1?" and R has given back the answer: 2.

You can read this as R telling you that the first (and only in this case) part of the answer is 2. The fact that it's the first part (indicated by the one in square brackets) is redundant here, but some questions have multi-part answers.

Execute the following operations by typing them into the code chunk below and hitting Run:

2 * 4

3/8

11.75 - 4.813

10^2

log(10)

log10(10)

sin(2 * pi)

7 < 10

```{r}

2 * 4

3/8

11.75 - 4.813

10^2

log(10)

log10(10)

sin(2 * pi)

7 < 10

```

Pretty nice. There are a few things worth noting here - some "default" behaviors hard-wired into R. These are important, as not all statistical software handles things the same way.

* In R, **log**(*x*) gives the natural log of *x*, and not the log to base 10. This is different from other software, which often uses ln() to give the natural log. Use **log10**(*x*) to make the log to base 10, or **log2**(*x*) for the log to base 2.

* The trigonometric function **sin**() works in radians (not degrees); a full circle is 2 x pi radians (not 360 degrees).

* Some mathematical constants, such as pi, are built in.

* The answer to **sin**(2 * pi) should be zero. The answer R reported was very close to zero but not zero - to get the exact answer, there is a different function that will multiply by pi correctly: **sinpi**(). **sinpi**(2) does equal zero.

* It is not always necessary to include spaces in your instructions to R (e.g., "1+1" will be evaluated in exactly the same way as "1 + 1"). R ignores white space (including spaces, new lines, and tabs). That said, good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.

* The last question is "is 7 less than 10?" R gets this right, with the answer "TRUE". The "less than" sign (<) is known as a "logical operator". Others include == (are two things equal?), != (are two things not equal?), > (is the thing on the left greater than the thing on the right?), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), | (the vertical bar symbol, not a big i or little L; is one or the other thing true?), and & (are both things true?).

You may have noticed that RStudio has some nice features, such as pre-placing closing brackets/parentheses where necessary. You've also just been introduced to a new concept: functions like **log**(), **log10**(), and **sin**(). All functions in R are defined by a word, or a combination of words containing no spaces, followed by an opening bracket "(" and a closing bracket ")". We will investigate functions in more detail later in the module.

All of the maths above gave just one answer each; however, R can answer several questions at once. For example, we can ask R "Would you please list the integers from 1 to 10, inclusive?" We can do this two ways - let's start with the easy way:

Type 1:10 into the code chunk below and hit Run:
```{r}

1:10

```

The answer to the question has 10 elements, yet there is still only [1] in front of everything. To simplify it's reporting, R has limited the square brackets to the left-hand side of the window and not told you that 2 is the second answer ([2]), 3 is the third ([3]), and so on. Try extending the sequence to 50 and see what happens:
```{r}

1:50

```

Clever! Note that you should now see multiple rows of data and an address (bracketed number, [*x*]) in front of each. Each address tells you which element (answer) can be found at the start of that particular row. Where exactly a line break appears will depend upon the width of the window on your computer screen. You can see this by making the Script window narrower or wider and rerunning the code chunk.

Typing 1:10 as you did above tells R to make a sequence of whole numbers that goes from one to ten in steps of one. You can also generate this sequence using the function **seq**(). Arguments control what functions do. The function **seq**() requires three arguments: the first value of the sequence, the last value of the sequence, and the step size between numbers (the difference in value between numbers in the sequence). Formally, the arguments associated with **seq**() are *to*, *from*, and *by*.

For example, type seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1) and hit Run:
```{r}

seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)

```

You do not have to write out the arguments by name - as long as they are in the correct order, the function will work as intended.

Type seq(1,10,1) and hit Run:
```{r}

seq(1, 10, 1)

```

See? Now try seq(10, 1, 1):
```{r}


```

Oops, that didn't work. It is generally a good idea to use the names of the arguments, if only to make your code easier to read for someone else (or for you at some point in the future). If you don't name your arguments, you are more likely to get a *red* error message like the one above (or perhaps worse, generate a function that did something different than what you had intended). Although R doesn't care how your code looks as long as it is correct, code should be written to be read and understood by people.

Since the existence of an error in your script will will prevent R from running all of the code from top to bottom without stopping, delete the incorrect code from the previous chunk before you move on.

Now modify the **seq**() function to provide a sequence from 1 to 10 in steps of 0.5 (don't forget to write out the names of the arguments). To make things faster, you can copy and paste the code from three chunks above and just modify the *by* argument:
```{r}

seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.5)

```

Great! So far, R has printed out the answers to questions in the Script window (although the book assumes we are still working in the Console, that is clearly incorrect); it has not saved them anywhere permanent. If you want to actually do anything with an answer, you will need to first *assign* it to an *object*. 

For example, type x <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.5) and hit Run:
```{r}

x <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.5)

```

A few things to note:

* We do the assignment by using the *assignment arrow*, which is a less than sign followed (without a space) by a minus sign: <-. The arrow points from right to left, so the assignment goes from right to left;

* We assign the answer to something called *x*. We could have used more or less anything (any text string that starts with a letter, more precisely) that we wanted here. Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_). Use underscores to separate words within a name - so called snake case. Strive for names that are concise and meaningful (this is not easy!). For example: day_one and day_1 are good object names, whereas DayOne, dayone, and first_day_of_the_month are not. Where possible, avoid re-using names of common functions and variables as this will cause less confusion for the readers of your code;

* After you hit Run, R did not show you anything new in the Script window; nevertheless, it did what it was told and is waiting for the next instruction. You can see that your command was successful, however, by looking in the Environment window (top right). There you can see a list of all the objects that have been created in the current R process; at the moment, x is the only one there;

You can also just ask R directly: type x and hit Run:
```{r}

x

```

Now, try asking R to give you the numbers from 101 to 110 in steps of 0.5 and assign these to an object called y. Then add together the objects x and y. It is as easy as you think... but before you do that, think about what you expect the answer will be.
```{r}

y <- seq(from = 101, to = 110, by = 0.5)
x + y

```

Great, you just added together two vectors (both a collection of numbers) and thus experienced the power of R! Note how R did the maths here - it added the vectors element by element. Remember, you can see y in the Environment window or by typing y and hitting Run.

### Your first script
Up to now, the book assumes you have been typing instructions in the Console; however, as was mentioned above, you should probably plan to (almost) never do that. In much the same way that an answer that has not been assigned to an object doesn't really exist, neither does a command that has not been saved to a file. The alternative is to type your instructions in the Script window where they can be saved, and then send them to the Console when you want R to run them. Such scripts typically have file names with the extension .R, e.g., foo.R. You can open, edit, and run a script by clicking *File*, and then *New* or *Open File*...

This section of the book provides a useful introduction to scripts, but note that we are working in an R Notebook - a special version of an R Markdown (e.g., foo.Rmd) file. R Notebooks are extremely useful for organizing data, visualizations, and analyses into a single document, but differ somewhat from scripts. The [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) gives you a quick introduction into how R Markdown works.

Regardless of whether you decide to use R Markdown or scripts, either approach allows you to end up with a *permanent*, *repeatable*, *annotated*, *shareable*, *cross-platform* archive of your analysis. That is awesome!

In an R script, the # is a symbol that declares that anything after it on that line is a comment, i.e. an annotation. These are words for you, not for R. We recommend starting your scripts with some information about the script, e.g., the date, author (you), and perhaps the purpose of the script (e.g., "# One-way ANOVA of fiddler crab body temperatures (*T*bs) by crab size (small or large) and sand water content (wet or dry)"). RStudio makes it easy to comment or uncomment line by line: after selecting the lines you want to comment, press *Command+Shift+C* (Mac OS) or *Control+Shift+C* (Windows); using the same keyboard shortcut again will uncomment the section.

In an R Notebook file like this one, any text outside of a gray code chink is considered to be commented out, so there is no need to include the #.

### **rm**(list = **ls**())
In multiple places in the book, you are told that you should have the following line of code at the beginning of virtually every script you write: **rm**(list = **ls**()). The explanation is that it's always good to start a script with nothing left over from a previous R session (also called an R process), by first removing the entire list of objects from the Environment tab. Don't do this!

As Jenny Bryan helpfully explains in this post on [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/), the problem is that **rm**(list = **ls**()) does not, in fact, create a fresh R process; all it does is delete user-created objects from the global workspace. Many other changes to the R landscape persist invisibly and can have profound effects on subsequent development: any packages that have been loaded (see below) are still available; any options that have been set to non-default values remain that way; and lastly, **rm**(list = **ls**()) is hostile to anyone that you ask to help you with your R problems. If they take a short break from their own work to help debug your code, their generosity is rewarded by losing all of their previous work. Not nice!

The solution is to write every script assuming it will be run in a fresh R process. Do not save .RData when you quit R and don’t load .RData when you fire up R (in RStudio, this behavior can be requested in the *General* tab of *Preferences*).] Restart R very often and re-run your under-development script from the top. If you use RStudio, use the menu item Session > Restart R or the associated keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+F10* (Windows and Linux) or *Command+Shift+F10* (Mac OS). You can re-run all code up to the current line with *Ctrl+Alt+B* (Windows and Linux) or *Command+Option+B* (Mac OS). Try that now.

### Packages
R's functionality is distributed among many *packages*, each with a particular focus (e.g., the _**stats**_ package contains functions that apply different statistical methods). When you download R, many common packages are installed automatically; you can install additional *add-on packages* yourself. To get a list of all installed packages, go to the packages window. If the box in front of the package name is ticked, the package is loaded (activated) and can be used.

There are many more packages available on the R website. If you want to use a given package (for example, the _**tidyverse**_ package) you need to first install it by clicking *Install* in the packages window and typing "tidyverse" or by typing install.packages("tidyverse") in a code chunk. Do that now:
```{r}
```

Much like an error message, leaving an **install.packages**() function in your script will will prevent R from saving the file in an exportable format (more on that below); if necessary, delete the install.packages(tidyverse) code from the previous chunk now.

Next, load the package by checking the box in front of "tidyverse" in the *Packages* window or typing **library**(tidyverse) in the code chunk below and hitting Run:
```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

Don't worry about the reported conflicts (marked with a red x); that is just R telling you it will use the newer version of any functions with the same name.

At this point, the book asks you to install two add-on packages: _**dplyr**_ and _**ggplot2**_. You don't need to do this, as both are part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. If you check the output above, you will see that both packages were already installed, along with half a dozen other packages.

Typically, you will want to list at the beginning of a given script the explicit library() calls for all packages needed to run it, and none that are not needed. If your script uses add-on packages, load them all at once at the very beginning of the file. This is more transparent than sprinkling library() calls throughout your code or having hidden dependencies that are loaded in a startup file. You do not, however, need to *install* the packages every time you start a new R session; just if you were to delete them or update to a newer version of R.

### Getting help
How do you get help in R? The classic way is to type "?function_name" in the Console. This will pull up the Help tab (bottom right window in R Studio) containing R's help information about the function. For example, ?read.csv() will give you the help file for the **read.csv**() function. You can also type directly into the search box in the help window. Finally, in R Markdown, you can ask for help in a code chunk.

Type ?read.csv() and hit Run:
```{r}

?read.csv()

```

The R help files can be pretty tough to understand, but after some practice are often very useful. Take the time to go through them...

R help files have a formal structure: they always start with the name of the function and the package to which it belongs and a short *Description*. Note that **read.csv**() is actually a special case of the **read.table**() function in the "utils" package. Don't know what that is? Ask R for help by typing ?utils:
```{r}

?utils

```

You can also just type the function name directly into the search box at the top of the help window; however, if you do this, don't include the question mark. You can tab forward and backwards through the help requests you have submitted in a given R session using the arrows at the top of the Help window. R help files usually contain sections called *Usage*, *Arguments*, *Details*, *Value*, *Authors*, *References*, *See Also*, and *Examples*. One useful feature is that you can copy any of the examples and paste them into the Console or a code chunk and they will run; this allows you to figure out how a given function works.

Pay attention to details when writing code in R - they matter! For example, **read_csv**() is not the same function as **read.csv**(). Call the help file for **read_csv**() to confirm that for yourself:
```{r}

?read_csv

```

**read_csv**() is a newer function created as part of the tidyverse. As we will see in Chapter 2, it sometimes handles data import a bit differently than **read.csv**(), so it is important to always know which functions you are using in your script.

There are lots of other ways to get help in R:

* Google is great - search for something and add the letter R and you will usually get lots of relevant results;

* As was mentioned earlier, [R Studio cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are concise and dense compilations of many common and useful functions and tasks. You can also access these via the Help menu above;

* Finally, there are multiple books on R and R Studio, many of which are open-source and available online for free. Among the most useful for this course will be: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is all about how to do data science with R; and [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), which provides lots of code recipes to help you generate high-quality graphs quickly using **ggplot2**().

### A mini-practical
To give you some practice using code chunks in R Studio, reading and using help files, and to challenge you a bit, try the following exercises. The answers are in the figures below, so you can see what you are aiming for. You'll need to use two new functions to solve these exercises: **qplot**() and **rnorm**(). **qplot**() makes a plot, and **rnorm**() generates random numbers from a normal distribution. Don't forget to look at help files!

Just so that you know you can, first clear the global environment by clicking on the broom icon at the top of the Environment tab (top right pane). That's equivalent to using **rm**(list = **ls**()), so it isn't something that you want to have hard-wired into a script; however, it can be useful sometimes.

Okay; let's do this! (Solutions are provided in Appendix 1a of the book, but try to figure it out on your own first.)

Plot a graph with x^2 on the y-axis and x on the x-axis, with a line:

<center>
![Fig. 1.1. The solution to the first problem.](R4All_fig1.1.png)
</center>

```{r }

?qplot
x <- -10:10
qplot(x, x^2, geom = "line", ylab = "y")

```

Plot a graph with the sine of x on the y-axis and x on the x-axis, with a line:
<center>
![Fig. 1.2. The solution to the second problem.](R4All_fig1.2.png)
</center>
```{r}

x <- seq(0,25,0.1)
y <- sin(x)
qplot(x, y, geom = "line", ylab = "y")

```

Plot a histogram of 1000 random normal deviates:
<center>
![Fig. 1.3. The solution to the third problem.](R4All_fig1.3.png)
</center>
```{r}

?rnorm
qplot(rnorm(1000))

```

Nice work!

### Some final tips and hints for a successful R experience
Like any computer file, you should be saving your script regularly as you work. When you save an R Notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it; click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file. You can also *Knit* the notebook into a PDF (or other type) file. *Preview* shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor; it does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. In contrast, *Knit* runs all code chunks as part of the rendering process.

When you quit R, you will likely be asked if you want to save the workspace - say No! This is not the same thing as your script (.R) or Markdown (.Rmd) file. By ensuring that each time you restart R (which you should also be doing regularly to check that your code is functioning correctly!) you have a clean workspace, you can’t accidentally depend on values you created last time.

In fact, let's tell RStudio right now to stop asking by clicking *RStudio*, followed by *Preferences* and *General*, and then unchecking the box for "Restore .RData into workspace at setup" and setting "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to *Never*. Actually, let's go ahead and uncheck everything except for the options under the "Other", then click OK (R will probably need to restart at this point).

Finally, RStudio has some other nice features that you may not have noticed yet:

* It allows you to comment or uncomment sections of code;

* It automatically indents code;

* It offers suggestions for completion of code;

* Function help appears while scripting;

There are many more, some of which we will cover in future exercises...

### Wrapping up
Save your file and exit the R session.
